# My-first-programming-language-applied
My personal repository displaying all of the javascript concepts and them being applied via projects using the knowledge I applied from each section. The projects are nested in each section. Course challenges, Self-challenges, guessing game,etc.

# My  project was making a guessing game in the web browser run locally via live-server. #
The project can be found under the Object Oriented Programming/Class Syntax folder. The file is called guessingGameLatest.js Just cd into the class syntax folder to run it. There are previous iterations of this project found in the repo as well. The other project was making a basic expense tracker which is found under the advanced arrays folder.
